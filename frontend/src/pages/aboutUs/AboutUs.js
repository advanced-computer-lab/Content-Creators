            <p>Abbas Ibn Firnas was a great astronomer who built a mechanized planetarium with revolving planets stars, clouds,thunder and lightning produced by hidden mechanisms in the room. He studied mechanical devices and timepieces. </p>
            <p>He designed a water clock called Al-Maquia, He also devised means of manufacturing glass from sand to produce silica and quartz glass, and he developed a chain of rings that could be used to display the motions of the planets and stars. He also developed a process for cutting rock crystal. Up to then, only the Egyptians knew how to facet crystal. Thereafter Spain no longer needed to export quartz to Egypt, but could finish it at 
                home. He make an artificial weather simulation room, in which spectators saw stars and clouds, and were astonished by artificial thunder and lightning. 
                These were due to mechanisms hidden in the basement</p>
